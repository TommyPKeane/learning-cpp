## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:).
